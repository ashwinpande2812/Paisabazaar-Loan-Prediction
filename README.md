# Paisabazaar-Loan-Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts the **Credit Score** of individuals based on financial and demographic data.  
It was created as part of my project on **Paisabazaar-Loan-Prediction**.

We implemented multiple models, and finally selected **Gradient Boosting Classifier** as our best model.

The dataset contains the following important columns:
- Age, Occupation, Annual Income  
- Num_Bank_Accounts, Num_Credit_Card, Interest_Rate  
- Delay_from_due_date, Num_of_Delayed_Payment  
- Credit_Utilization_Ratio, Credit_History_Age, Payment_Behaviour  
- Target: `Credit_Score` (Poor, Standard, Good)

##  Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Label encoding for categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Outlier detection  

3. **Machine Learning Models Used**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Boosting (Final Selected Model)  

4. **Final Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier**  
   - Achieved best accuracy among tested models  
   - Saved as `gradient_boosting_model.pkl`
